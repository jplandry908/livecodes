# Keyboard Shortcuts

Many commands can be executed from the keyboard using keyboard shortcuts. The full list can be found in the keyboard shortcuts menu, accessed from the Help Menu or from the [command menu](./command-menu.md) by pressing <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>K</kbd> (or <kbd>âŒ˜</kbd> + <kbd>K</kbd> on Mac) and searching for "Keyboard Shortcuts".

The code editor shortcuts are the same as VS Code, which can be found [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/getstarted/keybindings#_basic-editing).
